# research
material relating to graduate research

includes data for my dissertation.
Incremental data from Chapter 2 can be found in ./incremental_data/

key for incremental data:
[trace line number] [squashed writes at byte] [squashed writes at line level] [total writes wih no squashing] [fraction of writes eliminated. byte level] [fraction eliminated. line level] 

files ending in .incremental - numbers for only that interval of 100k lines
files ending in .cumulative - cumulative stats for full trace up to that point

Data from Chapter 3 can be found in ./recycling_data/
